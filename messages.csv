working in the biomedical field you must live under the assumption that people are generally good and deserve saving
come and see whats playing in the theater of life these days
visual architecture of disability
the art of mourning the living
to know how to be happy one must suffer first in essence everything is Hegelian

What kind of scientist do you want to become?
What would success look like for you?
What motivates you when progress is slow?
How do you respond when things go wrong under pressure?
How do you handle stress?

The skyscrapers winking at you in orange bursts from the sun
dont wait for things to come to you go find them and pursue it strongly

you too can own a piece of the one battle after another set with a la fermiere yogurt jar as a plant pot
Greedily devoured. Hunger as a metaphor for grief. A metaphor for a metaphor.
and as the year comes hurtling past
What you love will follow you wherever you go
we carve an idol out of fear and call it god
To be young is to be malleable to change
the interiority and connectedness of college life
